[Connfa](http://connfa.com/about/) is an Open Source framework for conferences and events.
Alongside mobile apps (Android and iOS) and a web app, it also offers a Content Management System and an integration server, written
in PHP (Laravel).

This aims to wrap [Connfa CMS and Integration Server](http://connfa.com/documentation/) into a Docker image, 
publicly available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/inrya/connfa/) to make it easier to get the server up and running and
seed the database with test data, to be able to quicly asses the suitability of the framework.
